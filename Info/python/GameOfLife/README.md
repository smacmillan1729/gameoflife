## Task ##

Your task is to implement the rules of Conway's Game of Life as explained in the document statement. You can use the code skeleton provided here as a starting point. In that case, implement the `evolve` method in `Life.py`. Feel free to make changes to the code that help you capture all the rules of the game. You can add more tests to `testlife.py` to verify the correctness of your code.


## Prerequisites ##
* Your favorite text editor
* Install [nosetests](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Alternatively, you could try one of these [python IDEs](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments)

## How to run the testsÂ ##
In a command line, navigate to this directory and just run `nosetests -v`
